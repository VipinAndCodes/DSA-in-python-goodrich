"""In our implementation of the scale function (page 25), the body of the loop
executes the command data[j] = factor. We have discussed that numeric
types are immutable, and that use of the = operator in this context causes
the creation of a new instance (not the mutation of an existing instance).
How is it still possible, then, that our implementation of scale changes the
actual parameter sent by the caller?

"""
Lists are mutable, so what changes in the list are the references to new, immutable objects.

In other words, scaling creates a new object, but its reference is stored in the original list structure
